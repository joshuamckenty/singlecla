# Single CLA

Version 1.0.0-pre.7

## Purpose

This contributor license agreement, or CLA, sets out the terms and guarantees that I give for my contributions to others' projects.  That way, others can accept my contributions without fear of licensing problems, and I can sign a single CLA, rather than one for each project.

## Scope

This section makes clear when this CLA applies to my contributions.

### Pull Requests

This CLA applies to every pull request I open on this website offering a contribution to a free, public project that consolidates rights to license all contributions in a single organization or individual, the project steward, such as a foundation, company, or lead developer.

### Exceptions

This CLA does _not_ apply to a pull request if I specifically say it does not in a comment to that pull request.  For example, I might say:

> My Single CLA does not apply to this pull request.

### Withdrawal

This CLA does _not_ apply to any pull request that I open after removing this signed CLA from the `singlecla` repository of my account.

## Licensing

This section gives project stewards confidence that my contributions come under acceptable license terms.

### Others' Work

When I make contributions including others' work:

1. I promise to take basic steps to make sure that work is licensed under standard terms [certified by Blue Oak Council and rated "bronze" or better](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list).

2. I promise to include copies of copyright notices, license terms, and other licensing documentation in my contribution, so the project steward can tell from files in the project's repository who licensed what work under what terms.

### My Own Work

When I make contributions of my own work:

1.  I license the project steward to do everything with my work that would otherwise infringe all copyrights in it that I can license.

2.  I license the project steward to do everything with my work that would otherwise infringe any patent claims that I can license.

3.  These license grants cover copyrights and patent claims I can license at the time, as well as copyrights and patent claims I become able to license later.

4.  I license the project steward to pass these rights on to, or sublicense, anyone or everyone, under any terms they choose, one or many times.

5.  I cannot and will not revoke these license grants.

5. ***As far as the law allows, my work comes as is, without any warranty or condition, apart from my promises about [right to license](#right-to-license) under this CLA.***

## Right to License

This section gives project stewards confidence that I actually have the legal right to contribute the work I offer.

### All Work

When I make a contribution, I promise that all the work in it will be covered by this CLA, either as [others' work](#others-work) or as [my own work](#my-own-work).

### Awareness

I am aware of legal rules, like ["work made for hire"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire) rules, that can give employers and clients ownership of intellectual property in work that I do.  I am also aware that legal agreements I make [can transfer ownership of intellectual property in my work to others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(law)).

### Company and Client Work

When I offer a contribution with permission from a company or client who may own rights in it, I promise to mention that in a comment to my pull request, as well as whether and how they gave me permission to contribute it.

### Company and Client CLAs

If a project steward asks me to help get a CLA from a company or client that may own rights in my contribution, I promise to help the project steward request that someone with authority to sign contracts for the company or client sign a reasonable CLA covering my contribution.

## Reliability

I fully expect project stewards, users, and distributors to rely on this CLA.  I understand they might enforce this CLA as a legally binding agreement.
